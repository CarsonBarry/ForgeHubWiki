# Budget Glitch

### **Applying the glitch:**

1. Spawn 1 of every item
2. Set the "runtime maximum" to 1 higher than the amount placed on the map
3. On maps like Foundry and Sandtrap, you'll need to save & end few times to change all of the runtimes. This is because when you start the game the budget will be as if the runtimes weren't set, but as soon as you spawn, delete, or change the runtime of an item it reverts back.

Alternatively, you can download an already glitched version of any map.&#x20;

You may notice when using the budget glitch that you won't be able to spawn any more items even though you still have some left; this may be caused by one of many things, don't fret.

When you try to spawn an item it says, "Cannot spawn item too many on map" Your'e getting this message because you have hit the item limit; here's a way to solve that problem:

Once you start to have a lot of objects on your map, start to save and quit often. If you need to perfect the angle of some floating objects while doing this, it'd be a good time to do so. As you get near the completion of your map, start to delete any object you know for sure you'll never use. If you save and quit/delete enough, each object deleted should allow you to place about 10-20 new objects after saving and quitting, so long as you are careful not to run into the item limit. You must save very often, and count the objects placed after each save, if you run into the item limit, end the game. Now, you're going to have to go back in and place one less object than you did last time, delete one object you don't need, and then save and quit. Now you'll be able to place more objects.

### When you can't spawn 1 particular item:

This will happen if:

* YOU FORGE WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND THE HOST SWITCHES OR LEAVES
* If you spawn the maximum of an item and DELETE ANY OF THAT ITEM EVER.&#x20;

To fix the problem:

1. Save & restart the game
2. Change the runtime to 1 higher than the amount placed on the map If you don't have enough money at the start of the new game, you'll have to delete any item to change the runtime.
3. When your map is done You may notice that while the money glitch is applied that weapons and destructible items respawn faster than normal and an extra one will spawn. This can be a real problem and can completely break a map. Since the runtime is set 1 higher, the game says that an extra one of that item can spawn. What I suggest is that you save 2 versions of your map. The first would be the publishing version and the second would be your editor version. For the publishing version, delete all the extra budget glitch items, and change the runtime maximums of all the item back to normal. For the editor version, just leave the budget glitch on and use it if you need to make a second version like a 1.1 or something like that.
4. Review
5. Download Money Canvas Glitch Maps
6. Try not to forge with someone else while using the glitch
7. NEVER DELETE AN ITEM IF YOU'VE MADE THE MAXIMUM OF IT.
8. Save 2 versions of your map, 1 for publishing, 1 for editing.
