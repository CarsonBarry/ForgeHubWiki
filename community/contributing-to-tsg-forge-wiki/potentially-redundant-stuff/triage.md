# Triage

This wiki is divided into 3 sections:

### **General** - _Articles that don't only relate to Forge or Halo._

* Find things like general programming terms, guides on general game development concepts, such as level design, and links to various useful tools that can be used in conjunction with Forge to take your efforts to higher levels.

### **Halo Infinite** - _Articles that specifically relate to Halo Infinite._

* Halo Infinite is the focus of this wiki, more specifically Forge, even more specifically scripting.

### **Legacy Halo** - _Articles that relate to previous Halo games._&#x20;

* Members of TSG and other communities have written help articles, guides, and tutorials for previous Halo titles. This is an effort to preserve that knowledge and make it accessible.
* TSG is not a place to go to get help with these legacy titles beyond the articles hosted here on the wiki.
