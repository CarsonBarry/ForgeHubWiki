# The Scripter's Guild

{% embed url="https://discord.gg/ZpE3tcpZy9" %}

_TSG is a server based around UGC and game dev, founded by Halo creators. We wrote the wiki for Halo 5 scripting as it existed on ForgeHub and are responsible for many enhancements to content for Halo 5 matchmaking, including the creation of the Mythic KotH, Assymetric 1 Flag CTF for BTB, Pig of the Hill, and Roaming King modes, systems for weather volumes w/ excluded interiors and static spawn timers for weapons, as well as a myriad of other creations._
