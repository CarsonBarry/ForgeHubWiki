### "Forgeable" Area

_The region that can be used to build and can be occupied by players in Forge/Customs._

Canvases extend 2000 units from 0,0 in each direction on the X and Y axes. Objects can be placed outside of this region, but players (even in Forge) will have soft-kill UX when out of bounds. \
\
There is an additional safe area outside of the normal play/build space under each canvas's intended safe area, from (0,0,-2000) to (0,0,-8000) that has the same horizontal limits.\
