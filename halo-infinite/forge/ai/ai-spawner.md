# AI Spawners

AI Spawners are used to spawn campaign AI units. In order for the AI units to spawn, the boundary of the object must intersect a nav mesh. Depending on the type of AI Spawner being used, one to many campaign AI Units can be spawned at a time via droppod, Phantom, or in-place.

### Unique Properties

As with all Forge objects, AI Spawners can be configured to suit different needs for a map via unique properties in the Object Properties menu.

#### Unit Selection

A single campaign AI unit can be selected for spawning via the unit selection menu. Unit type and weapon type can be configured here, with the weapon type being dependent on the species of the unit.
A For example, Grunts can only use pistols, while Jackals can use pistols and shouldered weapons, like the M392 Bandit and Cindershot. Only base weapon types can be selected in the dropdown menu.
