# AI Spawning

Campaign AI units are placed in a map using AI Spawners. In order for the AI units to spawn, the boundary of the object must intersect a nav mesh. 
Depending on the type of AI Spawner being used, one to many campaign AI Units can be spawned at a time via droppod, Phantom, or in-place. A
maximum of 32 AI units can be spawned at a time.
