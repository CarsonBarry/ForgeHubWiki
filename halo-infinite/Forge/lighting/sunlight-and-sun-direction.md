{% hint style="info" %}
Controls the Sun direction, intensity, and color. A good note is that the sun will still render even going past 90 degrees on the horizon. Unless it is wanted, or you would like to have a fully interior map with no sun contribution, set the intensity to 0 and it will save performance but turning the sun "off".
