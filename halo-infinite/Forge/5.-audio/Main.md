## "2D" Audio

2D audio describes audio that plays at full volume for all affected players. There is no evidence of 2D audio in multiplayer beyond the AI and Spartan VOs (voice overs) and Ping UX.

## 3D Audio

3D audio is emmitted from a coordinate location and fades with distance. Ambient audio is handled this way, as is the output of the `3D Audio` nodes that are available via the Nodegraph (scripting).

Scripted 3D audio can still be set to be played for specific players or teams. 

**Trivia:** 
*The 3D audio nodes available in the Nodegraph (scripting) were not present in the Nov 2021 Flight that was exploited to access Forge and the nodes present at the time did not specify if they were 2D or 3D.*
