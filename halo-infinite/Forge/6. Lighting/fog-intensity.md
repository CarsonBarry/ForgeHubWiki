# Fog Intensity

Fog Intensity is a parameter available on Generic lights that allows users to adjust the amount of volumetric fog emitted by the light source. This setting is proportional to the overall volumetric fog settings configured in the Map settings. However, it provides a localized control, enabling users to customize the fog intensity for specific lights. This feature is especially useful when you want to create diverse atmospheres by varying fog levels between different areas illuminated by lights.

**Notes:**

* Volumetric fog must be enabled in the Map settings.
* The fog density should be set above 0 for Fog Intensity adjustments to take effect.
* The fog color must not be set to black for this feature to work properly.

Additionally, understanding the concept of near and far ranges is essential:

* If you observe the fog disappearing as you approach an object, it indicates the near range in action. Volumetric fog doesn't render up close to the camera, ensuring a clear view of nearby objects.
* Conversely, if the fog vanishes in the distance, it signifies reaching the light's far range. Beyond this point, volumetric fog does not render, creating a defined boundary for the fog effect.

By manipulating Fog Intensity, creators can craft visually compelling environments with precisely tailored fog effects, enhancing the overall atmosphere of their scenes.
