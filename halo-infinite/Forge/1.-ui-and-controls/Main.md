## Overview

At a glance, Halo Infinite's Forge is modeled heavily after Halo 5. The default control scheme for controllers is also reminiscent of Halo 5's defaults. Users of previous titles have control schemes available to choose from to have an experience closer to those titles. 

While the menus are similarly placed and handle very similarly to Halo 5's there is the addition of radial menus that can be called for accessing functions like object grouping (now one-and-the-same with prefabbing), group welding, opening a Script Brain's nodegraph, etc., and the options available across the board are much deeper.

It is apparent, via nodegraphs, the expanded lighting options, and more, that many cues have been taken from more fully-featured game dev IDEs and repackaged to work well and have parity between console and pc. As with any tool of this complexity and depth, there is a learning curve present with this tool, but it remains that the surface-level is as accessible as it has been with all previous titles.

## Controls

There are multiple stock control schemes available (Default, Default Alt, and Legacy) and you are able to further rebind idividual controls if they do not fit your needs. You can also adjust context-specific control sensitivities in the Tools Menu. 

## Menus

# Pause
The same pause/settings menu you would see when in mode selection or lobby menus, or while in a game in Customs, Matchmaking, or Campaign, but with Forge-relevant options on the main page.
