# Set AI Difficulty

## Description
Changes Global AI Difficulty, ranging from Easy to Legendary, and Co-op Scaled Difficulty, which scales difficulty based off the number of players. Only newly-spawned squads will have the new difficulty, so the node can optionally Kill All Squads to ensure difficulties match.
