# ForgeWiki
*A place for editors to collaborate on content for the Forge wiki.*

## Structure

- Each markdown file is a page on the wiki.
- Each folder is a page on the wiki, with a `Main.md` that holds its content

## Formatting

The site uses markdown, so everything should include appropriate markdown formatting. A breakdown of the syntax can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

[as the project progresses, a standard formatting will be developed and expressed here]

## Why is this here?

It was the original plan to update the wiki on ForgeHub, but it was deemed more apt to partner with Halopedia and contribute to their already stellar collection of Halo reference material, while also mirroring this content to other community wiki sites. This currently only exists as a space to draft material for distributing elsewhere.

## How do I contribute?

You *can* just interact with this like any other repo, or you can get in on the conversation with the people working on this project in a dedicated fashion via the avenues below. Reach out to `Captain Punch` if you have questions or issues.

*TSG is a server based around UGC and game dev, founded by Halo creators. We wrote the wiki for Halo 5 scripting as it existed on ForgeHub and are responsible for many enhancements to content for Halo 5 matchmaking, including the creation of the Mythic KotH, Assym 1 Flag, Pig of the Hill, and Roaming King modes, systems for weather volumes w/ excluded interiors and static spawn timers for weapons, and more, as well as a myriad of other creations.*
