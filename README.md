# ForgeWiki
*A place for editors to collaborate on content for the Forge wiki.*

## Structure

- Each markdown file is a page on the wiki.
- Each folder is a page on the wiki, with a `Main.md` that holds its content

## Formatting

The site uses markdown, so everything should include appropriate markdown formatting. A breakdown of the syntax can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

[as the project progresses, a standard formatting will be developed and expressed here]

## Why is this here?

This allows for a more structured contribution pipeline for the Forge wiki than is currently in place via the site (ForgeHub) itself, it also acts as a back up of the information on the site. It was the original plan to update the wiki there or migrate to a new platform hosted by ForgeHub, but it was deemed more apt to partner with Halopedia and contribute to their already stellar collection of Halo reference material. This currently only exists as a drafting space while new structure is planned and implemented on Halopedia proper.
