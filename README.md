# ForgeHubWiki
*A place for editors to collaborate on content for the ForgeHub wiki.*

## Structure

- Each markdown file is a page on the wiki.
- Each folder is a page on the wiki, with a `Main.md` that holds its content

## Formatting

The site uses markdown, so everything should include appropriate markdown formatting. A breakdown of the syntax can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

[as the project progresses, a standard formatting will be developed and expressed here]

## Why is this here?

This allows for a more structured contribution pipeline for the ForgeHub wiki than is currently in place via the site itself, it also acts as a back up of the information on the site. 

## How do I contribute?
