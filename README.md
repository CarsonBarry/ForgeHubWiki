# Welcome

Halo Infinite's Forge and Scripting, especially for newcomers, can be an insurmountable obstacle without proper reference material. Our goal is to provide knowledge and information to help you navigate some of the obstacles that may come your way.\
\
Keep in mind, this is an entirely volunteer effort and all information here is provided and maintained by community members going out of their way to collect, organize, and format it appropriately.

## Where to start?

For Forge related topics, head over to [Forge](broken-reference), for Scripting information, go to [Scripting](broken-reference) and for User-Generated Content and working with files, [UGC](broken-reference).

{% endcontent-ref %}

After reading the basics and the linked articles, you should be able to formulate ideas and questions with more confidence, as well as bridge your own knowledge gaps with trial and error. To browse more free-form knowledge that the Forge community has discovered about Forge and Scripting, check out the [Guides and Knowledge](broken-reference) section.

## I can't find the information I need on the wiki

The wiki is an ever-evolving work in progress largely managed by just a handful of people. The source of nearly all of the information on the wiki is The Scripter's Guild Discord server, where the information is collected and discussed.

If you've looked around the wiki and still have questions, hop to the discord and put a question in the `[#ðŸ¤· | forge-help]` or `[#ðŸ¤· | scripting-help]` forum. Your question and the answer to it may end up being the source of an article, as many others have been.

<summary>About The Scripter's Guild</summary>

The Scripter's Guild (TSG) is a server based around UGC and game dev, founded by Halo creators. We wrote the wiki for Halo 5 scripting as it existed on ForgeHub and are responsible for many enhancements to content for Halo 5 matchmaking, including the creation of the Mythic KotH, Assymetric 1 Flag CTF for BTB, Pig of the Hill, and Roaming King modes, systems for weather volumes w/ excluded interiors and static spawn timers for weapons, as well as a myriad of other creations.

Memebers of The Scripter's Guild community help each other on the Discord server and are discovering new things about Halo daily. \
