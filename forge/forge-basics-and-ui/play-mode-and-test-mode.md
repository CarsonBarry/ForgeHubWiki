In Forge, there are multiple 'modes' that can be accessed. By default, the user is in Edit Mode and the player model is a Forge Monitor. Users can take control of a spartan biped at their current location in Edit Mode by transitioning to Test Mode, but this will not build the node graph for the level nor execute code from it.

To test scripting in Forge, the user must enter Play Mode, which spawns the player in at a proper spawn point and simulates a play session. Some code, notably anything to do with FFA Affiliations, must be tested in Customs.
