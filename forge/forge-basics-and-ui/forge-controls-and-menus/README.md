# Forge Controls and Menus

This section will explain what controls and shortcuts are available in Forge and what the purpose of each menu is.

## Introduction

At a glance, Halo Infinite's Forge is modeled heavily after Halo 5's. The default control scheme for controllers is also reminiscent of Halo 5's defaults. Users of previous titles have control schemes available to choose from to have an experience closer to those titles.

While the menus are similarly placed and handle very similarly to Halo 5's, there is the addition of radial menus that can be called for accessing functions like prefabbing, group welding, opening a Script Brain's node graph, etc., and the options available across the board are much deeper.

It is apparent via node graphs, the expanded lighting options, and more, that many cues have been taken from more fully-featured game dev IDEs and repackaged to work well and have parity between console and pc.

As with any tool of this complexity and depth, there is a learning curve present with the tool, but it remains that the surface-level is still accessible enough to build simple levels. The forger will just need to know the majority of the toolset in order to bring their level to a higher standard, which wasn't previously possible, and now is expected of the top performing levels.
