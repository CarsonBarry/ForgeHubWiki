# Cubemaps

### Cubemap Coordinates

* Institute: (0, 0, 1000)
* Arid: (0, 0, 1000)
* Ecliptic: (0, 0, 1000)
* Void: (0, 0, 1000)

### Stock Multiplayer Levels

The absence of custom light bake in stock multiplayer levels and the inability to re-bake lighting on these levels renders cubemap locations irrelevant for those levels.
