Bots are a new addition to the Halo franchise as Halo Infinite is the first title with built-in bot support. Bots are computer-controlled player bipeds who act based on information they are given about the current situation in the match.

Bots operate mostly based on pathfinding the nav mesh on a level so having a well supported nav mesh on your level is crucial for a great bot gameplay experience.
