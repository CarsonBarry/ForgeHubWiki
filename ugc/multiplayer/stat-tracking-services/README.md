# Stat Tracking Services

Even though 343 has a robust API that documents a lot of your stats for each game, they have done quite a bad job at displaying this info to the average user. Due to this, Halo community members have reverse-engineered the undocumented Halo Infinite API and created their own stat tracking services utilizing the information that can be obtained from this API.

Luckily thanks to these TSG recommended websites, you as the user don't need to know more information than to just input your gamertag into one of these websites to search up your stats in a well-formatted manner.
