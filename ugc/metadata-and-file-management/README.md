# Metadata and File Management

User-Generated Content (UGC) is a term used for all assets created by the Halo community in Halo Infinite. Knowing how to manage your own files and how to find others' files is important both for Forging and for playing Custom Games. This section will focus on everything you need to know about the files you own and how to get them out for others to experience.

## UGC UI does not update

{% hint style="danger" %}
Halo Infinite's UGC User Interface (UI) <mark style="color:red;">does not automatically update</mark> when a metadata change is made. Whenever you make a metadata change such as changing the File Name, you need to go back to your map selection and press the "Refresh" button at the bottom of the screen to display the latest version that you just created.

This has caused numerous issues for Forgers early on as this was not understood properly due to bad UI communication design.

If multiple metadata changes are made without refreshing the file and adding the changes to the latest version, only the very last metadata edit will show up in the last version of the file.
