## Overview

At a glance, Halo Infinite's Forge is modeled heavily after Halo 5. The default control scheme for controllers is also reminiscent of Halo 5's defaults. Users of previous titles have control schemes available to choose from to have an experience closer to those titles. 

While the menus are similarly placed and handle very similarly to Halo 5's there is the addition of radial menus that can be called for accessing functions like object grouping (now one-and-the-same with prefabbing), group welding, opening a Script Brain's nodegraph, etc., and the options available across the board are much deeper.

It is apparent, via nodegraphs, the expanded lighting options, and more, that many cues have been taken from more fully-featured game dev IDEs and repackaged to work well and have parity between console and pc usage. As with any tool of this complexity and depth, there is definitely a learning curve present with this tool, but it remains that the surface-level is extremely accessible as it has been with all previous titles.
